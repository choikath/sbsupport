## At Scheduling

_**Before scheduling, please check:**_
Please view upcoming patient appointments, procedures, and lab tests also occurring on the same day.  If the patient will be in-person for another reason, please provide patients that they may ideally find a private, quiet place to conduct their telemedicine appointment.

## Scheduling For Optimal Clinic Flow

* Bookending days with Telemedicine appointments are preferred for smoother clinic flow.  

    - In particular, starting with telemedicine visits is preferred, as in-person visits tend to run late and may compress and delay later appointments.


## Designated, Private Spaces for Patients
