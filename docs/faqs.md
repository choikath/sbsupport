* **What are the web browsers to access the Switchboard and Blue Jeans?**
    - Microsoft Edge  Google Chrome  Safari (Mac users)  Please do not use Internet Explorer, as it is not compatible
* **Do I need a Blue Jeans account to access the Blue Jeans meeting in the Switchboard?**
    - No account needed.  You can join the Blue Jeans meeting as a guest. Currently, standalone Blue Jeans accounts are needed to schedule/conduct group sessions, and patient interactions that are not scheduled in PennChart.
* **Why did my patient join a different Blue Jeans meeting/ received a different meeting link/ID?**
    - There could be a number of reasons:  The patient may have multiple telemedicine appointments and has joined a different telemedicine appointment.  If the appointment has been rescheduled, each meeting will have a different meeting link/ID. The telemedicine team is working on a solution to maintain the same meeting link/ID when an appointment is rescheduled with the same provider for the same day.
