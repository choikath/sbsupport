_Additional speciality or practice specific Telehealth Visit Types in development_


## Updating A Visit

* **Recommended:** ONLY use **Cancel then Reschedule** appt
    - This creates a new CSN and ensures all reminders are sent with new modality
* Avoid: Change workflow. Patients may not receive notification of the changes!

>**Remember**: Whenever a conversion happens, patients have already received modality-specific reminders from the original appointment. Patients may get confused whether to come to the visit in person or not, so please remind them they should reference the latest reminders.

   To minimize confusion, convert visits **_BEFORE THURSDAY NOON_** the week prior to the appointment.
